# BrickBreaker

This a simple single player game of BrickBreaker which is written in *ES6 JavaScript* so it should be run in **Google Chrome** 
as it fails to properly load in **Internet Explorer**.

The paddle in the game can be controlled by both the **keyboard** (by using left and right arrow keys) but also can be controlled by the 
**mouse** depending on the users preference. 

The user is given *3 Lives* at the start of the game and objective of the game is to break all the bricks before finishing off your lives. 

If the speed of the ball is **too fast**, it can be made slower by changing the number in `setInterval(draw,5)` 
function in my *simpleGame.js* file to a higher number (i.e. try 10).
